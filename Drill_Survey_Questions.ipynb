        "  Google and facebook already did a great job defining what popularity is using network graphs.\n",

        "  LET US ASSUME THOUGH YOU CAN'T DO THAT! Getting good data on what people prefer by asking them is riddled with all the aformentioned biases.\n",
        "  How might we derive this popularity? What is the rise in Trojan condom sales during Pride Week as compared to a base line sales during the year. How does this compare with other anomolous holidays with in the year? The comparrison of these two metrics now needs to be normalized by survey population statistics.\n",

        "\n",
        "First let's define rental rate as the rate in which someone rents a car. NOT the rate it costs to rent a car.\n",
        "\n",
        "  You could survey not the user(Sellers). However, let's think about what Happycars is. They are a broker. They help increase the liquidity in a market by matching many buyers to many different sellers. Understanding this in the context of a market economy means Happycars does not set a price they run a marketplace. Imagine you were for instance TD Ameritrade and users started buying index funds like crazy (Thanks Vanguard). Would you survey users as to why they are doing this? Probably not, you don't really care so long as you can convince buyers (ie traders) to be on your platform and match to sellers (ie other traders). This is because other than providing a matching service you can't controll market effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Next let's make the following assumption. It's a 30% increase across the board (world) in rental rates. WOWZERS!! How can we keep this going? The folks up in marketing say if this trend continues EVERYONE WILL BE RENTING CARS! \n",
        "  \n",
        "  Then some intern points out that gas prices world wide have dropped a substantial amount. Then another intern SCREAMS out \"OH MY F***!\", \"peace in the middle east was achieved and aparently the one state solution WORKS?!\". \n",

        "  Suddenly everyone in the marketing department feels like an asshole for not reading the headlines of the New York Times that morning because they were too busy fantisizing about the fat bonus check they were going to recieve with out all with out knowing it was because peace in the middle east was achieved not because of anything they did what so ever.\n",
        "\n",
        "  So what is my point here? Quite simply, large anomolous evenly distributed shifts in user activity could be largely attributed to market effects of which a marketplace has 0 control over.\n",
